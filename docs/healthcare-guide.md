## FDA Data Interpretation Guidelines

### Understanding FDA Database Content

#### **Drug Shortage Database**

- **Data Source:** FDA Drug Shortages Database
- **Update Frequency:** Real-time
- **Information Available:** Supply chain data, therapeutic alternative information
- **Limitations:** Shortage resolution estimates may change

**Data Interpretation:**

- **"No shortage found":** Drug currently available through normal supply chains
- **"Shortage reported":** Limited availability, alternative information available
- **"Shortage resolved":** Previously reported, recurrence monitoring data available

#### **FAERS (Adverse Event Database)**

- **Data Source:** FDA Adverse Event Reporting System
- **Data Type:** Voluntary reports, not causality-proven
- **Information Available:** Safety signal data, risk assessment information
- **Limitations:** Reporting bias, confounding factors

**Data Interpretation:**

- **Pattern recognition:** Multiple similar reports may indicate safety signals
- **Individual reports:** Cannot establish causality alone
- **Serious events:** Death, hospitalization, disability data for evaluation

#### **Drug Recalls (Enforcement Database)**

- **Data Source:** FDA Enforcement Reports
- **Update Frequency:** Real-time (never cached for safety)
- **Information Available:** Patient safety data, medication review information
- **Classifications:**
  - **Class I:** Life-threatening situations
  - **Class II:** Temporary/reversible adverse health consequences
  - **Class III:** Unlikely to cause adverse health consequences

### Medical Safety Protocols

#### **Emergency Situations**

When patient safety is immediately at risk:

1. **Check recalls first:** Use `search_drug_recalls` for urgent safety alerts
2. **Review serious adverse events:** Use `search_serious_adverse_events` for life-threatening reactions
3. **Current data:** These tools do not use cached data

#### **Routine Clinical Practice**

For standard medication management:

1. **Prescribing decisions:** Use `get_medication_profile` for comprehensive information
2. **Patient counseling:** Use `search_adverse_events` for safety discussion
3. **Formulary planning:** Use `batch_drug_analysis` for multiple medications
