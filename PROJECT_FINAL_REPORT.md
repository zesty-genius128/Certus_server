### 2. FDA API Integration
- **Multiple Database Access**: Integrated drug shortages, enforcement, adverse events, and labeling APIs
- **Intelligent Search**: Multiple fallback strategies for drug name variations and misspellings  
- **Error Handling**: Healthcare-specific error classification with actionable user guidance
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection with 100 requests per 30 minutes per IP

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Caching System**: Medical-safety balanced caching (24hr labels, 30min shortages, 1hr adverse events)
- **Performance Gains**: Measured 13-41% faster response times with intelligent caching
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and monitoring for production stability
- **Batch Processing**: Support for analyzing up to 25 drugs simultaneously

### 4. Client Integration
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with Claude Desktop, LibreChat, VS Code, and custom MCP clients
- **Connection Methods**: Direct HTTP and stdio wrapper for maximum compatibility
- **Configuration Tools**: Simple setup commands for all major MCP clients

### 5. Monitoring and Analytics
- **Usage Analytics**: Real-time endpoint tracking and request monitoring
- **Cache Statistics**: Performance metrics and hit/miss rate analysis
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks with detailed status reporting
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive logging with troubleshooting guidance
