## ðŸš€ After Cleanup

Your project will be much cleaner with just the essential files. You'll have:

âœ… One working server (mentioned in the `package.json`)

âœ… Core functionality (`openfda-client.js`)

âœ… Local testing capability (`stdio-wrapper.js`)

âœ… Clean documentation (updated `README`)

This makes your project much more maintainable and easier to understand! ðŸŽ‰
